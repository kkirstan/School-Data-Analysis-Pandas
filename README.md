# PyCitySchools Data Analysis
In this challenge I created a pandas script using mock school data (schools_complete.csv & students_complete.csv, "PyCitySchools/Resources") to analylze district-wide standardized test results. In this analysis I will find: an overall district summary, a summary of test results by individual school, the top and bottom 5 performing schools, math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores based on average budget per student, scores based on school size, and scores based on school type.

**The code (main.ipynb) can be found in the folder "PyCitySchools".**

**The write-up of observable trends (PyCitySchools_Analysis.docx) can also be found in "PyCitySchools".**

# District Summary
Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:

Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

# School Summary
Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:

School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

# Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:

School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

# Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.

# Math Scores by Grade**
Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


# Reading Scores by Grade
Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

# Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:

Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

# Scores by School Size
Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

# Scores by School Type
Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
